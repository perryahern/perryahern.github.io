short-description: Chatting with Bloc Chat!

---
#### Summary ####
As part of my coding education at Bloc, I was tasked with developing an online chat room app using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Angular.

#### Explanation ####
Unlike previous coding work at Bloc, which had largely depended on using code provided by Bloc, I was now largely on my own. User stories were provided along with some basic information and hints with a few bits of code, but the majority of the work was on me.

#### Problem ####
Bloc tasked me with developing a chat app that would provide functionality whereby users could set a username for themselves, create chat rooms, select a desired room to chat in, enter messages that were associated with only those rooms, and the room and message data would be stored in a database.

At the same time, however, a "perfect storm" of bad timing of events in my personal life and problems with my Bloc mentor collided with the need to take my first true steps as a coder and knocked me off balance. Just when I needed the most focus I had the least and, as a result, I floundered.

#### Solution ####
A bit of guidance from Bloc and more from my mentor combined with lots of Google research and copious amounts of blood from beating my head against this seemingly impenetrable wall eventually yielded an app I'm proud of. Persistence, questions, research, and more persistence were the key to the solution.

Regarding the problems that had temporarily derailed me, a new mentor and the resolution of external issues gave me the foundation I needed to stand again and begin to walk the coding walk on my own.

#### Results ####
I developed a chat app that provides the required functionality and a bit more. I plan to return to it and develop it further in the future.

#### Conclusion ####
I can do it. I need to believe in myself and not allow external problems and doubts to derail me.  *Persistence, not resistance. Try, try again, bleed, succeed.*
