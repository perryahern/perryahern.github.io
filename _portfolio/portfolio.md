#### Summary ####
Next up: Show the world what you've done by developing a portfolio site.

#### Explanation ####
Bloc tasked me with creating a portfolio site using a Jekyll theme.

#### Problem ####
I have never worked with a pre-configured theme and was not familiar with constructing posts using markdown, editing config files, and such.

#### Solution ####
After a bit of stumbling about and finding the right way to work with the theme I was able to construct the pieces I needed, update the config files, create my own resources, and get the portfolio up and running.

#### Results ####
It's basic, but it'll do. For now. ;-)

#### Conclusion ####
It's an easier step than the last, but it presented new problems and new opportunities to learn. My new mantra: *Try, try again, bleed, succeed.*
