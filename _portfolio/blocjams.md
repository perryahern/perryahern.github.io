short-description: Learning the Bloc Jams way!
---

#### Summary ####
As part of my coding education at Bloc, I was tasked with developing an online music player.

#### Explanation ####
Bloc laid out the parameters for the program and guided me through its development. Initially developed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I later refactored it to create a version using jQuery and another using Angular.

#### Problem ####
I had a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was not enough of an understanding, however, to create an online music player that would mimic functionality found in currently existing services.

#### Solution ####
Utilizing Bloc's code, I worked to gain greater understanding of these systems and to begin to add sections using my own coding knowledge. The initial version using native JavaScript was almost entirely based on Bloc's code; the jQuery version allowed me to begin utilizing some of my own code, and I had even greater opportunities while writing the Angular version.

#### Results ####
While I still have much to learn, my knowledge of these technologies has grown and, at the same time, my belief in my abilities has increased. There's a long way to go, but I'm on the right track.

#### Conclusion ####
Learn by doing. It's the only way.
