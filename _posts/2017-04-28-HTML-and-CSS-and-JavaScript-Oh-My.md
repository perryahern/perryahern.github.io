So much to learn, so much to learn!

It's been a few weeks since I began my journey at Bloc and I've been plunged into learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned the basics through online courses as directed by Bloc and moved quickly though that phase. The courses were relatively easy and the exercises straightforward. My only concern was the fact that a lot was being learned without much actual coding. It felt like there was a whole lot of theory and not a lot of practice.

I've gotten into the first big project, Bloc Jams, which has me coding an online music player. It's interesting work and I'm learning as I go, but I have to admit that I thought I'd be doing my own coding by now. I know I can't code something like this music player with my current skills, but I thought I'd have written some code for small projects that I'd be able to manage on my own and that would stretch my skills while allowing me to achieve success and reinforce my belief that I can do this. I guess every school has its own way of doing things and that's now how it's done at Bloc.

I know it won't always be this way, though, and I'm looking forward to the day that I write the code on my own. My only fear is that my first foray into writing code will be at a level of complexity that will be difficult to work with. If I had my druthers, as they say, I'd rather be writing my own code in increasing complexity to build up rather than typing in Bloc's code as it gains complexity. A mix of the two, preferably; I write some, Bloc writes, some, and I learn from both. Yes, I'm learning, but I learn better by doing. This is more typing than doing, and it makes me a bit nervous because I'm not demonstrating my mastery of it to myself.

There are bits, though, where I'm asked to write some code. I enjoy those challenges, as well as the CodeWars challenges that I'm completing. At least these are giving me that sense of success that I'm craving.

The time to code on my own is coming. Until then, I'll follow the yellow brick road!
