title: Angular&#58; A Love/Hate Story
---
My journey learning Angular has been an interesting one as my feelings while working with it have swung from one extreme to the other. Maybe the terms "love" and "hate" are more extreme than my actual feelings at the time, but there sure were times when I experienced pain and suffering while trying to understand Angular and make it work. I guess it also didn't help that I was trying to learn to work with a database at the same time, but the data had to go somewhere!

The methodology is so different than what I have previously worked with. I first learned to program years ago in a very sequential manner, so getting used to working with so many files handling various pieces of the puzzle has taken a lot of getting used to. Add to this all the controllers, directives, states, views, and so on and you can begin to see why I've struggled to adapt to Angular.

Now, though, with a couple projects under my belt, the pieces are making more sense. I still have to lay them out carefully and deliberately, thinking it through more thoroughly than the rest of my code, but it doesn't seem like a mysterious collection of files and code that somehow magically work together to produce a working site.

I do like the single page app design and the two-way binding that Angular provides, and I have projects in mind that I want to apply it to. But first, back to the Bloc. So much to do, and so little time to do it!
