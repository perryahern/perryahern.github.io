title: From the Ashes
---
It's been a long month. Not since my last post; since I last made significant progress. I wrote previously about the difficulties I'd fallen into, the "perfect storm" that had knocked me down. I took a beating, and it sure did knock the wind out of me for a while, but I'm coming back. I refuse to be beaten. I recognize now that I played more of a role in it than I initially thought, though the external factors did still play a significant role as well.

But let's move forward. It's time to rise from the ashes and achieve my potential. I have a great new mentor, Mike, who has helped me to find my footing and begin to make strides again. I have moved through that personal issue that was haunting me, and I've worked through problems and found help from my family. The darkness that I was consumed by has receded, and I can see the light again. I was not in a good place, and I know I was miserable to be around for a month or more. I hope never to return to that place or to inflict that on my family again.

The coding is still hard, but I can approach it with a clear mind and face it optimistically. The journey will have its ups and downs, but I need to persevere. Like I said before, I'm going to make it through. My belief in myself is renewed, and I'm not going to let anything hold me back from completing this journey.

It's the journey of a lifetime, and I have but taken the first step.
