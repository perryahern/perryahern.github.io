title: Life, the Universe, and Everything
---
I've reached that point that I have anticipated and feared for same time: coding on my own. Unfortunately, things have gone much worse than I hoped. Just when things started to get tough in the program, life, the universe, and everything have conspired against me to make it even more difficult.

Late in the project to refactor Bloc Jams into an Angular app there were an increasing number of areas where we were asked to write more code than normal, and with the beginning of Bloc Chat that's became the norm. There's little instruction and a few sample bits of code; the rest is up to me. I've been struggling to make the transition, for a number of reasons.

For one, it's hard. Learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and now Angular in a short time leaves you overflowing with theory that has seen little practice, so trying to plant my feet and stand on my own under this weight of newfound knowledge has been difficult. Add on to this some other problems that have been thoroughly distracting and that "difficult" has been upgraded to "near impossible." In discussing this phase with my family, I've come to call it "the perfect storm" of problems. Just like in the movie of the same title, when multiple things that are each difficult to handle in their own right collide in your life, such a perfect storm can occur.

Take one part learning overload and practice "underload" and combine it with a mentor situation that was not working for me, a personal situation that was haunting me, and some financial and other concerns that were eating away at the little bit of sanity that was left and you might begin to understand why things are going wrong. I've lost confidence in myself, and every time I try to look at the assignment I get lost in doubt and frustration, unable to think clearly.

I'm not giving up, though. Life, the universe, and everything may be in my way right now but I'm going to get through it. I've been stuck at the same point for some time, but I'm taking steps to get out of this pit and I'm going to survive this perfect storm.
